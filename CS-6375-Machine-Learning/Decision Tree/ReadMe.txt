Note1: For running different pruned trees stated in q9  the comment tag before that particular prune statement must be removed and rest of the prune statements should be commented.

Note2: To run diffrent dataset for the tenth question, in driver.py we should comment iris dataset line and un comment the other data set.
       We should also uncomment the prune statement in the end for diffrent dataset as nodes would be different and comment the rest of the prune statements.
